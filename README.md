## Functionality overview

The example application is a Search Page that searches the products based on food category.

**General Guidelines:**

- Used Typescript with React Redux and Hooks.
- Purposefully used both ways of states and dispatching actions, i.e locally and with the help of redux stores.
- Used CSS and Bootstrap for styling.
- The Api used has no support for taking search terms, so used client side search with debounce.
